The file was further updated in May 2020. The update primarily include the 13C and 14C isotope in soil organic carbon. All 14C are set to 1/10000 of 13C at this stage (will be updated when data are available).

The 13C data are from citation:

This file was updated on Nov 27, 2017. The update was carried out with new simulation of 2000 years of AD spin up and 100 years of final spin up. The carbon in litter, soil pools were updated to observational carbon density. The oxygen, hdrogen, methane, carbon dioxide concentration along soil profile are in reasonable ranges.
